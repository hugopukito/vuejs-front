    I'll describe in each section the different elements you'll need to
    build this custom keyboard <br>
  </div>
  <div class="text">
    Be aware of the compatibility between components you'll choose, there are plenty of possibilities
    for each element in a keyboard. <br> <br>
    I'll give the reference of each element I use to make my keyboard. <br> <br>
    Mine is a 65% ISO-FR keyboard, didn't found any seller of this size combined with this layout üò≠

  <div class="text">
    To make the link between where you're typing on the keyboard and your computer, 
    you'll need a Printed Circuit Board <br> <br>
    There are different size and layout of PCB, I'll explain everything. <br> <br>
  </div>
  <div class="text">
    The size means the numbers of keys you want on your keyboard, 100% is a full keyboard, 
    mine is a 65%, no number pad and function row. More info 
    <a href="https://switchandclick.com/keyboard-sizes/" target="_blank"> here </a> <br> <br>
    The layout depends on your country, if you're used to manipulate a qwerty keyboard, your layout is ANSI. <br> <br>
    Otherwise, you probably need an ISO layout, in my case I choosed an ISO-FR layout (because I'm üá´üá∑).
  </div>
  <div class="text">
    The last parameter to take into account is how you'll fix your keys on your keyboards. <br> <br>
    When you'll press a key, the switch will make contact and give electricity on a specific place of your PCB,
    then your computer will recognize the key you pressed. <br> <br>
    So you need to fix the switch (part of the keys, we'll see later) on your PCB, you can solder it or just plug it. <br> <br>
    I recommand taking the hotswap version, so you can easily take in and off switches from the PCB. <br> <br>
    If you're an old school, maybe you'll prefer to solder every single switch to your PCB.

    The PCB I choosed is the CK65 (rgb üåà) from candykey, it's a 65%, ISO-FR and hot swappable PCB. Reference

    Case

  <div class="text">
    Now you've found what type of keyboard you want to build, you can choose the house of your PCB. <br> <br>
    What you'll need to buy is the case, you can choose between different materials (plastic, wood, aluminium & resin). <br> <br>
    There are plenty of cases for the 65% keyboards, it depends on your preferences, examples
